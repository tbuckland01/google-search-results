# Google Search Results Project
This is the optional, more difficult version of the google homepage mini-project assigned by The Odin Project. Similarly to the [easier version](https://github.com/tbuckland01/google-homepage), this project is based only on the alignment and styling of items, so none of the links/buttons lead anywhere!
